As a graphic artist, we often get lost in the maze of plugins. What is the one that fit my needs, will it work on my computer … ?

00:10.334 --> 00:13.891
On the other side, as a plugin creator, it is hard to display our work in a cool way

00:14.000 --> 00:19.428
and to raise people awareness on how the plugin works and the possibilities behind our abstract lines of code.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.250
Thankfully, a lot of cool people worked on the matter and created the OpenFX Standard.

00:25.500 --> 00:30.200
It allows your plugins to work directly in many softwares on every platform ...

00:30.350 -->  00:33.700
But a big issue remains, how to find a cool plugin ?

00:33.800 -->  00:37.239
For this purpose, we’ve created ShuttleOFX !

00:37.500 --> 00:41.800
Graphic designer or plugin developer, now is the time to put on your spacesuit ! 

00:42.000 --> 00:50.818
ShuttleOFX is designed to display all the existing plugins and give you a quick overview on both :  how does it work and how a render would look like ?

00:51.100 --> 00:54.647
So that you’ll be able to use it in your production at light speed !

00:54.900 --> 00:56.384
If you are part of the industry,

00:56.600 --> 00:57.695
a researcher,

00:57.900 --> 00:58.603
or a student,

00:58.900 --> 01:03.394
ShuttleOFX is a great tool to share your work with a whole new galaxy. 

01:03.900 --> 01:07.502
Putting your work on the plateform is as easy as a drag and drop !

01:08.100 --> 01:11.543
ShuttleOFX gives you a great analysing tool.

On the Shuttle, you can make live render of any plugin. 

01:16.016 --> 01:18.267
ShuttleOFX is a versatile app !

01:18.865 -->  01:20.433
It saves you the time of downloading a plugin,

01:20.514 --> 01:21.400
install it,

01:21.905 -->  01:23.000
and try it on your plateform,
