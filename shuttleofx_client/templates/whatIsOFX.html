                    <p>
                        OFX is actually several things.
                        At the lowest level OFX is a generic C based plug-in architecture that can be used to
                        define any kind of plug-in API. You could use this low level architecture to implement
                        any API.
                        The basic architecture could be re-used to create other higher level APIs such as a sound
                        effects API, a 3D API and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This guide describes the basic OFX plug-in architecture and the visual effects plug-in
                        API built on top of it.
                        The visual effects API is very broad and intended to allow visual effects plug-ins to work
                        on a wide range of host applications, including compositing hosts, rotoscopers, encoding
                        applications, colour grading hosts, editing hosts and more I havenâ€™t thought of yet.
                        While all these type of applications process images, they often have very different work
                        flows and present effects to a user in incompatible ways. OFX is an attempt to deal with
                        all of these in a clear and consistent manner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The API is by design feature rich, not all aspects of the API map to all hosts.
                        This is to allow different host developers to implement OFX support in a manner that
                        best fits their applications' capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hosts are encouraged to extend OFX by providing extra proprietary suites,
                        actions, properties and settings to extend the capabilities of the API.
                        It would be nice that a broadly useful proprietary extension be put forward
                        for incorporation into the open standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said although there is no validation process in terms of what is an OFX host,
                        a small minimal set of expectations is assumed, which we will cover in the following guides.
